# UnRaid
Sharing some of my UnRaid settings


## TL/DR
Running these settings without verifying they are fit for your purposes could lead to loss of your data. Don't come running to me when this happens ;)

I currently run "Version: 6.11.1"... I can't vouch that these will work on older/newer versions of UnRaid
... use them blindly at your own risk.

Also, they are MY preferences....my preferences may not suit your needs
... be sure to read through what is being setup BEFORE you blindly use them.

You have been warned.
