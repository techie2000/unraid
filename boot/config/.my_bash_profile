# When we launch the “interactive login” terminal, the first file it searches for is “/etc/profile,” 
# The “/etc/profile” file sets up the environment for all users.
# 
# After that, it searches for other files and executes the command from the file it finds first. 
# 
# “.bash_profile” sets up the current shell’s environment. 
# If “.bash_profile” is not present, then it will look for “.bash_login” or “.profile” files. 
# 
# Upon launching the “interactive non-login” terminal, the only file read is “.bashrc”
# Most distributions have “.profile” in the place of “.bash_profile”; all shells read the former while the latter is only read by the bash shell.
# 
# The “.bash_profile” will be executed when you log in to your machine to configure your shell environment, 
# The “.bash_profile” file is responsible for setting up the environment using environment variables that store information about text editor, layout settings, etc. 
# It executes only once when you log in to your machine. 
# Whereas “.bashrc” contains commands, aliases, bash functions and runs when you open the terminal and also executes when you open a new instance of the terminal.
