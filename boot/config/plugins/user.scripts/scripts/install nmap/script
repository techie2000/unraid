# nmap (network scanner) Nmap ("Network Mapper") is an open source utility for network exploration 
# or security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine 
# against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are 
# available on the network, what services (ports) they are offering, what operating system (and 
# OS version) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of 
# other characteristics. Nmap runs on most types of computers, and both console and graphical 
# versions are available.
# 
# Usage: nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] {target specification}
